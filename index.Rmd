## About Me

I am a doctoral student in the School of Criminal Justice at the University of Cincinnati.
My research focuses on policing and the geographic concentration of crime. I enjoy using **R** 
and **ArcGIS** to analyze large amounts of data and identify high crime places. My recent work has 
been featured in *Crime and Delinquency* and *Police Practice and Research*.
